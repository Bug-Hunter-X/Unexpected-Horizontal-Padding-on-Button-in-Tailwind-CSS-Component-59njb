# Unexpected Horizontal Padding on Button in Tailwind CSS Component

This repository demonstrates an unusual bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS. A simple button component displays unexpected horizontal padding, despite employing standard utility classes. The hover effect functions correctly, but the initial padding is excessive.  This issue occurs without any custom CSS overriding the default Tailwind styles.

## Bug Description

A button element styled with Tailwind's `bg-blue-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, `text-white`, `font-bold`, `py-2`, `px-4`, and `rounded` classes exhibits significantly more horizontal padding (`px-4`) than visually expected.  No custom CSS overrides these classes.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully inspecting the component's structure and potential conflicting classes or parent styles that might unintentionally affect padding. In this case, there were no such conflicts, so there is no explicit solution. This issue might be related to Tailwind CSS's internal configuration or potential browser-specific rendering behavior.
